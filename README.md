# Coders - June Sprint 1

A Django-based project developed to implement a simple user management and attendance tracking system with API support. This system is designed with two primary user typesâ€”**Staff** and **Community Members**â€”and supports daily sign-in/sign-out functionalities.

---

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a foundational backend system where:

- **Community members** can check in and out daily.
- **Staff users** can manage attendance and oversee the system via the Django admin panel.
- APIs are exposed to support frontend integration for sign-ins and check-outs.

The project is divided into three main Django apps:

- `users` â€“ Custom user model with roles
- `attendance` â€“ Daily check-in and check-out system
- `dashboard` â€“ (Optional/Bonus) Admin or insights dashboard

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django 4.x
- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Database**: SQLite (default)
- **API**: Django REST Framework *(recommended)*
- **Testing**: Django built-in test suite
